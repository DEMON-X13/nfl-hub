    node nhl/tools/smoke.js        (from the hub root or from nhl/tools)

   Must end "0 failures". Checks are against the page's invariants and against reality, never
   against what the day's data happens to offer: an off day, a lean slate, opening night, a day with
   no injury report, a game already played or postponed, the playoffs and the summer must not fail it.

   Reality, each read here on its own terms and never through the job's code:
     - the injury report (nhl/data/injuries.json): no row's id is the string "undefined"; the
       lineups still to play were built on this report; nobody it has out, on injured reserve or
       suspended is in his club's lineup or named in goal, and no goalie it lists under another club
       is named for his old one (a goalie DailyFaceoff confirms stands)
     - the box scores (nhl/data/box_<season>.jsonl): a goalie named by the model's own rule has
       played for the club this season or last, and once the club has three games this season he
       started one of them, unless every goalie who did is out or gone; a goalie said to be on the
       second night of a back to back is (the club's game before is the day before) and is not
       the one who started that night (its box score) or is named for it (a game still to come);
       a game under way or over and not yet boxed is not compared, since its card is the call
       frozen at puck drop, which may be an older run's goalie
     - DailyFaceoff (nhl/data/starters.json): a goalie it names for a game still to come, who is a
       rated goalie of that club and not out, is the one in goal on that game
     - the clock: a call is never made after its puck drop; a call shown before puck drop is the call
       graded, field for field, against the last published state (NHL_PREV_STATE, else git's
       HEAD:nhl/state.json; a row an older job wrote after puck drop is exempt), a game delayed less
       than half a day counting as started; no started call of that state is gone from this one
       unless `removed` gives the feed's reason (postponed, cancelled, or never final and unseen two
       days past its puck drop); the state is the job's second pass, never the first's; a call that
       is the player model's carries the player model's margin; and the page, opened at a game's
       puck drop, offers no bet on it and calls the visitor's day Today
     - the playoffs: a club knocked out has no Cup or conference chance, the champion has the Cup
   NHL_STATE, NHL_DATA and NHL_PREV_STATE move the files (simulate.js). */
