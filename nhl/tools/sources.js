/* The job's last step, after the commit: did a source the published state stands on break?

    node nhl/tools/sources.js        exit 1 when one did, after naming it

   The page always publishes on what there is and says so (an injury report carried from an earlier
   run, the model's own goalies when DailyFaceoff could not be read); this step makes the break seen
   too, by failing the run once the data is already live. It fails when, with a game in the next day
   and a half: the injury report in use is more than twelve hours older than the state, or there is
   none; ESPN's report rows mostly lack the id fetch_box.js reads from the player link (its shape
   moved; players.js is matching names alone); or DailyFaceoff answered on a game day and not one
   game could be read from it (its shape moved). DailyFaceoff not answering at all is a warning only:
   it answers GitHub's runners and not every network, and the next run asks again.
   NHL_STATE and NHL_DATA move the files (simulate.js). */
