/* The NHL job: read this season from ESPN, rate every club, call every game, freeze the call
   and the lines before puck drop, grade what has finished, simulate the playoff picture and
   write nhl/state.json, which is everything the page shows.

    node nhl/tools/update.js              the season, from ESPN: rate, call, grade, write
    node nhl/tools/update.js --scores     the job's first pass: the same season read, the scores, states and
                                          schedule written, and every call copied from the last state
                                          as it was, none made; last night's finals are then in the state
                                          before fetch_box.js boxes them and players.js lines up on the
                                          same schedule the second pass calls on
    node nhl/tools/update.js --offline    from the scoreboard files a previous run saved in nhl/tools/out/

   NHL_TODAY, NHL_NOW, NHL_STATE, NHL_OUT, NHL_TEAMS and NHL_DATA in the environment move the day,
   the clock and the files, which is how simulate.js plays a fabricated season through it without
   touching the real ones.

   Free: ESPN's public feeds only, nothing spends a credit. One request per day from the
   season's start to the end of June, skipping the days the last state already has complete,
   so the whole schedule is known and a pass in season is a couple of hundred small requests.
   A day the last state still has a game to finish on, through tomorrow, must be read fresh: if
   ESPN does not answer for one (or answers with no game where the last state has some, none
   called off and not all on another day now), the run exits 1 having written nothing, so the last
   good state stays live; a later day that fails keeps the schedule the last state had. A game
   leaves the schedule only when the feed marks it postponed or cancelled (or it has moved to
   another day): one an answer merely leaves out is kept as the last state had it, call, line and
   grade, and said (`kept`), and only one never final two days past its puck drop that the feed has
   not shown since goes. Every game taken off is listed in `removed` with the feed's reason, so the
   smoke test can account for each started call of the last published state.

   The call is frozen at puck drop, by the clock and not only by ESPN's state (a game delayed past
   its start is not called again, nor one whose start ESPN moves less than half a day later after
   the puck drop its call was made before): once a game has started, every part of the call shown
   before it (the chance, margin, total, overtime chance, the line, each side taken and whose call
   it was) is copied from the last state and graded as it stands, never recomputed. Only the second
   pass makes calls. A row an older job wrote after puck drop, which recomputed the puck-line side
   from the team Elo's margin, is put back to the call shown before puck drop from the inputs it
   kept (the player model's margin, the line, the chance and total): every pick, side and margin as
   that run computed it; the team Elo's view shown beside it (`elo`, display only) from the replay
   for a final and from the ratings as they stand while it is live. Games that were already over
   when this job first ran are graded from the replay and marked so.

   The model is nhl/tools/elo.js with the parameters fit.js wrote to nhl/data/model.json,
   replayed over the finished seasons (hist.js: history.json and the season_<year>.json files) and
   then this season's finished games, in date order. The first run of a new season (from August)
   writes the old season's finals, playoffs included, to nhl/data/season_<year>.json from the last
   state, so no season is ever dropped; with neither that state nor the file it exits 1.

   The playoff picture: before the regular season ends, the rest of it played SIMS times and the
   league's bracket off each simulated table; once it has ended the field is the real one, the
   series are the ones ESPN has, each played on from its real score, so a club knocked out has no
   chance left and the bracket carries each series' score. The field is the sixteen of that first
   round: a club the table's tie-breakers left out that ESPN has in a series is in for certain, and
   the club it displaced is out. `phase` says preseason, regular, postseason or over (the Cup
   awarded), offseason with no games at all. */
