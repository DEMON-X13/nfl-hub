/* The rating model: an Elo over the 32 clubs with home ice, a back-to-back penalty, a rest
   bonus, a goal-margin multiplier, a weight for a game decided past regulation, and a
   preseason regression toward 1500. Its win chance (the moneyline's, overtime and the
   shootout included) is the logistic of the rating gap; its expected goal margin is the gap
   divided by a fitted goals-per-Elo. A goals layer sits on top for the puck line and the
   total: each side's goals are Poisson, the two means placed so they add to the game's
   expected total (each club's scoring and conceding rates this season, shrunk to the league's)
   and differ by the expected margin; a game tied after sixty minutes goes to the side the
   ratings favour with the chance an overtime deserves, one goal to the winner, and a fitted share of the
   one-goal games is tied instead, since a trailing side pulls its goalie. fit.js chooses
   the parameters on 2011-12 to last season; update.js replays the history and this season
   with them, and this file is the whole model in both places.

   Conventions: `diff` is home minus away plus home ice and the rest terms, so a positive diff
   favours the home side; `homeLine` is the market's home puck line, -1.5 when the home side is
   favoured; `mu` is the model's expected home margin in goals; `periods` is 3 for a regulation
   result, 4 for overtime, 5 for a shootout. */
