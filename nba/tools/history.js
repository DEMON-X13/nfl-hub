 * Source: Neil Paine's continuation of the FiveThirtyEight NBA Elo file (every game since 1946,
 * one row per team per game), https://github.com/Neil-Paine-1/NBA-elo. Seasons from 2005 on are
 * kept, one row per game, with team codes mapped onto this site's and defunct franchises folded
 * into their current team (Sonics to OKC, Nets to BKN, Hornets to NOP and CHA). Rows the ESPN
 * fetch already wrote (source espn) are left alone; the history only fills what it lacks.
