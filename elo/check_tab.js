/* The ELO Ratings tab's own gate: nflbets/build/tab_elo.html run in jsdom on elo/data, with the
 * page around it stubbed (the schedule, the clock, the shields), so what the tab does with the
 * files is checked on the job's run, before anything is committed.
 *
 *   node elo/check_tab.js                  (from the hub root; jsdom is borrowed from props/build)
 *   node elo/check_tab.js --data DIR --tab FILE      (tests: another build's files or tab)
 *
 * Each check is the tab's behaviour on any week's files, never this week's names:
 *   - a game that has kicked off leaves the Mismatches (it was promoted as this week's edge
 *     for a game already played), and a player's window says so;
 *   - a Mismatches bubble wears the same season shield as the player's ranking and badge
 *     (it wore the raw career rating's, so one card disagreed with itself);
 *   - a player the build counts out (out last week and not practising, say) is ruled out on
 *     the page, with the build's reason in his window;
 *   - the rankings say how far the season has got as the build words it, a questionable
 *     player carries a Q, and the bar splits the ELO Model's record into calls made before
 *     kickoff and backtest;
 *   - every ranked player has a trend line, one game in too (week 1's column was blank);
 *   - a player kept out of the players map is priced by nothing, but the Prop Record still
 *     reads the rating he took into each week he played (it graded those weeks at 1500).
